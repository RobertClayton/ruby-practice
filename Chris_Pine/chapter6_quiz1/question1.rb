# Write down everything you know about methods.  Make sure to answer the following questions.
#   What are they for?
#   Where are they stored?
#   How do you use them?

# a method is a program that performs an operation to an object. (hopefully this is the currect terminology)

# to use a method, you append the method with a '.' after an object. An example with the 'upcase' method: puts string_object.upcase
# an exception to this rule is arithmetic methods (+-*/) which work either like this 'object.+ object' or like this 'object + object'

# I believe these methods are stored in the actual Ruby programs library.
# you can however define your own local method in the program you are writing.

# Feedback: Nice answers the questions!
