# Here are some pieces of code.  For each, say what the result is.  For each, say what type of value is created (eg integer, float, string).  For each, explain why.
#   ```

#   50 + 25
#   75. because Int+Int = Int

#   50 + "25"
#   error. You can't add a String to an Int

#   "50" + 25
#   error. You can't add an Int to a String

#   "50" + "50"
#   "5050". because String+String=String. They are text not numbers and so are concatenated not add.

#   ```
