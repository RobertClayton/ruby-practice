# Write a program that combines the following separate strings into one string: "Pesto", "pasta", "is", "tasty".

one = "Pesto"
two = "pasta"
three = "is"
four = "tasty"

puts output = "#{one} #{two} #{three} #{four}."

# Feedback: 
#  * The `output` variable doesn't need to be instantiated.  Ideally, programs do as little as possible to achieve their goal.
#  * Really nice use of string interpolation!
