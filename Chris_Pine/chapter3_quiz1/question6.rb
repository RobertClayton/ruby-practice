# Write a program that creates a single-quoted string that contains a single-quote.  Explain what happens when you run this program.  Explain why this happens.

puts 'This is a single-quoted string. The apostrophes tell the computer where the string starts and ends. However for some characters you will have to use a backslash, which tell the computer that the next character is still part of the string(so that the computer does not get comfused). For example - you\'re.'
