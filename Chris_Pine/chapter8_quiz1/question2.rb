# Write a program that:
# * Creates an empty array.
# * Adds two strings to it: `"tiger"` and `"lion"`.
# * Uses the correct index number to get the `"tiger"` string out of the array and print it.
# * Uses the correct index number to get the `"lion"` string out of the array and print it.

array = []
array.push "tiger"
array.push "lion"
print array[0] #tiger
print array[1] #lion
