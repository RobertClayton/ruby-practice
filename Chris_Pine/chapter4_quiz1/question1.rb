# Write a program that prints out the value "hello" five times.  Each "hello" should appear on a separate line.  The text "hello" should only appear once in your program.

text = "hello"

5.times { puts text }

# Did you want the program to look like this?:
# puts text	
# puts text	
# puts text	
# puts text	
# puts text

# Feedback: Both versions are great!
