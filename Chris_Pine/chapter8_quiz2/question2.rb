# Write a program that:
# * Demonstrates how to access the third element in an array.

array = ["1st element","2nd element","3rd element"]

# array directories start counting at 0
# so to access the 1st item in the array we would call: array[0]
# to access the 2nd: array[1]
# and the 3rd that we are trying to access:
puts array[2]
