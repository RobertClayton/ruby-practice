# Explain in a comment below why variables are called variables.

#Variable's are called variables because as their name suggests the value they are assigned to can change. For example if we have a variable: var1 = "variable". We can change var1's value("variable") to anything we want. For example: var1 = "I'm changed". or: var1 = 4.
